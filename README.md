# fMRI-Timeseries-Transformer-Conditional-GAN
A transformer based timeseries conditional GAN modelled to produce fMRI and temporal neurological readings.

The original project was inspired from working with Neuromatch. This repository is one of the generative models used with the game-theory and gambling Reinforcement Learning repositories on my Github.

This repository in specific could not have been possible without the feedback and discussions I had with [Xiaomin Li](https://xiaomin-li.github.io/) whose work on [TTS-GAN](https://github.com/imics-lab/tts-gan) and [TTS-CGAN](https://github.com/imics-lab/tts-cgan) provided a foundation and guidance for the architecture of this version of the model.

This project has undergone some changes and is therefore in its early stages. Feel free to [contact](https://github.com/robme-l/robme-l) me at [robme.l@tuta.io](mailto:robme.l@tuta.io).
